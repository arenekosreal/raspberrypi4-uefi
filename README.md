## What is this?
Files needed for booting Raspberry Pi 4 in UEFI mode.  

## How to use?
`PKGBUILD` file is designed for Arch Build System (ABS), you can know more about it at [there](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_Build_System). Here are the steps for using these files correctly:  
- Clone this repository.  
- If you are using Arch Linux or other distributions based on it such as Manjaro, you can run `makepkg` command in the directory which contains PKGBUILD file, finally, you can find software packages generated by makepkg program. Install them and reboot your Pi, you can enjoy it.  
If you are not using Arch Linux, you may have to understand Arch Build System and do the same when the `makepkg` program is run at this directory.  

## NOTE
1. Backup your Pi's files or at least backup boot partition. Or you may have to reinstall your original system.  
2. UEFI firmware is experimental, that means maybe some features may not work properly. You can get more infomation at [there](https://github.com/pftf/RPi4)  
3. Install grub with `--removeable` flag, or you have to choose boot from `/EFI/grub/grubaa64.efi` file in UEFI manually when your Pi is powering on.
4. This project is designed for `aarch64`(arm64) architecture, it is just for test so you can compile on `x86_64` machine with `aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc` toolchain. Due to my ability, if you compiled on a `x86_64` computer, the software package will be treat as `x86_64` package and you can't install it directly on your Pi although all binary files in this package is designed for running on `aarch64` machine. So I recommend you to compile this package directly on your Pi and install it or manually copy generated files to your filesystem.
