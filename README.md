## What is this?

Files needed for booting Raspberry Pi 4 in UEFI mode.  

## How to use?

`PKGBUILD` file is designed for Arch Build System (ABS), you can know more about it at [there](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_Build_System). Here are the steps for using these files correctly:

- Clone this repository.  
- If you are using Arch Linux or other distributions based on it such as Manjaro, you can run `bash start-build.sh` command in the root directory of this repo after installed requirements (see [Dockerfile](./Dockerfile) for more info), finally, you can find software packages generated by makepkg program at `out` folder. Install them and reboot your Pi, you can enjoy it. Note: choose which kernel you want (generic or raspberrpi), you can't use both kernel because they are conflict in their depends.  
If you are not using Arch Linux, you may have to understand Arch Build System and do the same when the `makepkg` program is run. Or use docker, see [CI config](./.github/workflows/build-packages.yml) for more info. CI is running on Ubuntu x86_64 host and you can use it as a reference. Note: final artifacts in `out` folder is Arch Linux Package, if you want to create package for your distribution, you shouldn't use docker and you should turn to read `makepkg` files.   

## NOTE

1. Backup your Pi's files or at least backup boot partition. Or you may have to reinstall your original system.  
2. UEFI firmware is experimental, that means maybe some features may not work properly. You can get more infomation at [there](https://github.com/pftf/RPi4)  
3. Install grub with `--removeable` flag, or you have to choose boot from `/EFI/grub/grubaa64.efi` file in UEFI manually when your Pi is powering on.
